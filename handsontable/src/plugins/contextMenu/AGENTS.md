# ContextMenu plugin — and the shared Menu class

`ContextMenu` (`'contextMenu'`) provides the right-click menu over cells and headers. It owns the shared `Menu` class that `DropdownMenu` reuses. Read this before touching `contextMenu.ts`, the `menu/` UI, or anything that `dropdownMenu` builds on.

## Context Menu vs Column Menu

`DropdownMenu` is built on the shared `Menu` class from `contextMenu` but is configured and triggered independently. When in doubt about which plugin owns a behavior, use this table.

| | Context menu | Column menu (dropdown menu) |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin class / key** | `ContextMenu` / `'contextMenu'` | `DropdownMenu` / `'dropdownMenu'` |
| **Trigger** | Right-click (or `Ctrl+Shift+\` / `Shift+F10`) | Column header button (or `Shift+Alt+ArrowDown`) |
| **Scope** | Cells and headers across rows and columns | Column-specific operations only |
| **Hook prefix** | `beforeContextMenu*`, `afterContextMenu*` | `beforeDropdownMenu*`, `afterDropdownMenu*` |

## `className` is `string | string[]` — never do string surgery on it

The `className` cell meta accepts a space-separated string **or** an array (both are documented in `metaSchema`). Always normalize it with `normalizeClassNames()` from `handsontable/src/helpers/dom/element.ts` and then work on whole tokens.

Two shipped bugs came from ignoring this. Both `.replace()`-based: #7427 (an array `className` threw on `.split`) and #7122, where `utils.ts` removed an alignment token with `.replace('htRight', '')` and then "tidied up" with `.replace('  ', '')`. That deleted the double space instead of collapsing it, so the two surviving class names were glued into one (`class_namehtMiddle`) and both stopped matching. The same substring matching also chopped custom classes that merely contained an alignment name (`htTopBar` → `Bar`).

Match alignment classes by exact token (`classNames.includes('htRight')`), as `exportFile/types/xlsx/cell-style.ts` already does — never `indexOf`/`includes` on the raw string.
