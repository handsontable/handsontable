# Roadmap

We are on a mission to create the best data editing component for teams, and we're doing it with [your feedback in mind.](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/discussions)

Our roadmap includes the big strategic projects we are tackling, but that's not all. Each release also features bug fixes, documentation updates, and smaller tweaks suggested by our paying customers and community users.

Since the front-end world changes quickly, we might shuffle the order of projects from time to time (usually once a quarter). Some new projects might get the green light while others might not make the cut.

The roadmap below was last updated on `May 14th, 2024`.

Curious about our progress? Check out the [Changelog](@/guides/upgrade-and-migration/changelog/changelog.md).
