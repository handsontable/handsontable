# Performance

Boost your grid's performance by setting a constant column size, suspending rendering, deciding how many rows and columns are pre-rendered, and more.

[[toc]]

## Overview

Handsontable performs multiple calculations to display the grid properly. The most demanding actions are performed on load, change, and scroll events. Every single operation decreases the performance, but most of them are unavoidable.

To measure Handsontable's execution times in various configurations, we use our own library called [Performance Lab](https://github.com/handsontable/performance-lab). Some tests have shown that there are methods that may potentially boost the performance of your application. These only work in certain cases, but we hope they can be successfully applied to your app as well.

## Set constant row and column sizes

Configure your [column widths](@/guides/columns/column-width/column-width.md) and [row heights](@/guides/rows/row-height/row-height.md) in advance. This way, Handsontable doesn't have to calculate them.

::: only-for javascript

```js
const hot = new Handsontable(obj, {
  colWidths: [50, 150, 45],
  rowHeights: [40, 40, 40, 40],
});
```

:::

::: only-for react

```js
<HotTable
  colWidths={[50, 150, 45]}
  rowHeights={[40, 40, 40, 40]}
/>
```

:::

::: only-for angular

```ts
settings = {
  colWidths: [50, 150, 45],
  rowHeights: [40, 40, 40, 40],
};
```

```html
<hot-table [settings]="settings"></hot-table>
```

:::

When taking this approach, make sure that the contents of your cells fit in your row and column sizes, or let the user change [column widths](@/guides/columns/column-width/column-width.md#adjust-the-column-width-manually) and [row heights](@/guides/rows/row-height/row-height.md#adjust-row-heights-manually) manually.

- [Column widths](@/guides/columns/column-width/column-width.md)
- [Row heights](@/guides/rows/row-height/row-height.md)
- [`colWidths`](@/api/options.md#colwidths)
- [`rowHeights`](@/api/options.md#rowheights)

## Turn off autoRowSize and/or autoColumnSize

You can configure the value of the [`autoRowSize`](@/api/options.md#autorowsize) and [`autoColumnSize`](@/api/options.md#autocolumnsize) options. These allow you to define the amount of width/height-related calculations made during the table's initialization.

For more information, see our documentation for [rows](@/api/options.md#autorowsize) and [columns](@/api/options.md#autocolumnsize).

## Define the number of pre-rendered rows and columns

You can explicitly specify the number of rows and columns to be rendered outside of the visible part of the table. Better results can be achieved by setting a lower number, as fewer elements get rendered in some cases. However, sometimes setting a larger number may also work well as fewer operations are being made on each scroll event. Fine-tuning these settings and finding the sweet spot may improve the feeling of your Handsontable implementation.

For more information, see our documentation for [rows](@/api/options.md#viewportrowrenderingoffset) and [columns](@/api/options.md#viewportcolumnrenderingoffset).

## Rule of thumb: don't use too much styling

Changing your background, font colors, etc., shouldn't lower the performance. However, adding too many CSS animations, transitions, and other calculation-consuming attributes may impact the performance, so keep them at a reasonable level.

## Suspend rendering

By default, Handsontable will call the render after each CRUD operation. Usually, this is expected behavior, but you may find it slightly excessive in some use cases. By using one of the batching methods, you can suspend rendering and call it just once at the end. For example:

::: only-for react
::: tip

To use the Handsontable API, you'll need access to the Handsontable instance. You can do that by utilizing a reference to the `HotTable` component, and reading its `hotInstance` property.

For more information, see the [Instance methods](@/guides/getting-started/react-methods/react-methods.md) page.

hot.batch(() => {
  hot.alter('insert_row_above', 5, 45);
  hot.setDataAtCell(1, 1, 'x');

  const filters = hot.getPlugin('filters');

  filters.addCondition(2, 'contains', ['3']);
  filters.filter();
  hot.getPlugin('columnSorting').sort({ column: 1, sortOrder: 'desc' });
  // The table cache will be recalculated and table render will be called once after executing the callback
});
```

## Consider using pagination

If you're struggling with performance when dealing with large datasets, consider enabling the [`pagination`](@/api/options.md#pagination) option. Instead of rendering all your data at once, pagination allows you to display only a subset of rows at a time, significantly reducing the rendering load and improving overall performance.

The Pagination plugin is particularly useful when:
- You have thousands of rows of data
- Your users don't need to see all data simultaneously
- You want to maintain responsive scrolling and editing performance

For more information, see our [Pagination guide](@/guides/rows/pagination/pagination.md).
