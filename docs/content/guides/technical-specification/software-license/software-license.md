## Non-commercial use

We allow you to use this software for such non-commercial purposes as, but not limited to, research, private study, and evaluation. Your use in commercial settings is strictly limited to evaluation, development and testing tier of a software deployment architecture.

**In other words, you canâ€™t enter the production stage if your project is in any way connected with your commercial activity.**

To use Handsontable in a non-commercial or open-source project, see the [License key](@/guides/getting-started/license-key/license-key.md) page.

## Commercial use

To obtain a commercial license key, contact our Sales Team directly, either through the [contact form](https://handsontable.com/contact?category=request_for_quotation) or by email at [sales@handsontable.com](mailto:sales@handsontable.com).

An enterprise license is available on demand.

```

::: only-for react

```
