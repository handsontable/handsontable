# Supported browsers

Handsontable supports all the most popular desktop and mobile browsers.

[[toc]]

## Overview

We carefully test our code on the **two latest versions** of most-popular modern browser, on both mobile and desktop devices. In addition to running unit and end-to-end tests, we focus on two factors that are crucial for all users: performance and accuracy of the user interface.

## Testing compatibility

Tests are run in [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) as well as on a limited number of physical desktop and mobile devices. Access to physical machines gives us an opportunity to measure the performance better which is hard to do with virtual machines.
