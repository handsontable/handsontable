## Coming in May 2021

We're in the process of integrating our other product, the [HyperFormula calculation engine](https://handsontable.com/blog/articles/2020/6/introducing-hyperformula-fast-javascript-calculation-engine), with Handsontable. We plan to release the first version in May 2021. Ultimately, it will allow us to replace the previous formula plugin with the new one.
