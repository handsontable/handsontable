## [13.0.0] - 2023-06-22

### Added

- Angular: Added support for Angular 16. [#10396](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10396)

### Changed

- **Breaking change (React, Angular, Vue 2, Vue 3)**: Changed Handsontable's policy toward older versions of supported frameworks. From now on, Handsontable supports only those versions of any supported frameworks that are officially supported by their respective teams. Dropping Handsontable's support for any older framework versions won't be treated as a breaking change. [#10396](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10396)
- **Breaking change**: Changed the order in which three hooks are executed: now, the `beforeChange` hook is fired before the `afterSetDataAtCell` and `afterSetDataAtRowProp` hooks. [#10231](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10231)
- Changed the margins of the context menu in the RTL layout direction. [#10375](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10375)

### Removed

- **Breaking change (Angular)**: Dropped support for Angular 13 and lower. From now on, Handsontable supports only those versions of Angular that are officially supported by the Angular team: currently, it's 14-16. However, Handsontable 13.0.0 was thoroughly tested and, to the best of our knowledge, works correctly with versions down to Angular 12. [#10396](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10396)
- **Breaking change**: Removed the deprecated `beforeAutofillInsidePopulate` hook. [#10407](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10407)
- **Breaking change**: Removed the deprecated `getFirstNotHiddenIndex` method. Instead, use the `getNearestNotHiddenIndex()` method. [#10407](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10407)
- **Breaking change**: Removed the deprecated parameters of the `alter()` method: `insert_row` and `insert_col`. Instead, use the following parameters: `insert_row_above`, `insert_row_below`, `insert_col_start`, and `insert_col_end`. [#10407](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10407)
- **Breaking change**: Removed the deprecated parameters of the `populateFromArray()` method: `direction` and `deltas`. [#10407](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10407)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the "Read only" icon of the context menu displayed incorrectly in the RTL layout direction. [#10375](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10375)

## [12.4.0] - 2023-05-23

### Added

- Added two new Handsontable hooks, `afterColumnSequenceChange` and `afterRowSequenceChange`, which are fired after changing the order of columns or rows, respectively. [#10215](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10215)

### Fixed

- Fixed numerous issues related to syncing Handsontable with HyperFormula. Now, formulas work properly with all the Handsontable features. [#10215](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10215)
- Fixed na issue where formulas didn't recalculate after rows or columns were moved. [#4668](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/4668)

- Fixed an issue where calling `updateSettings()` would reset HyperFormula's undo/redo actions stack. [#10326](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10326)
- Fixed an issue where the `Autofill`, `TrimRows` and `Formulas` plugins didn't work properly together. [#10200](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/10200)
- Fixed an issue where the `modifySourceData` hook used the wrong type of indexes. [#10215](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10215)
- Fixed an issue where text copied from Handsontable to Excel included wrong types of spaces. [#10017](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/10017)
- Fixed an issue where mousing over the same cell twice didn't trigger the `beforeOnCellMouseOver` and `afterOnCellMouseOver` hooks. [#10321](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10321)
- Updated TypeScript definition files related to the `CustomBorders` plugin. [#10360](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10360)
- Fixed an issue where moving rows manually to the bottom was difficult due the misalignment between the backlight and guideline elements. [#9556](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9556)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where column-filter checkboxes got reset when the table was scrolled out of view. We solved this by preventing the table from triggering a complete render each time it leaves the viewport. [#10206](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10206)
- Fixed an issue where clicking on a cell scrolled the table sideways in certain RTL configurations. [#10206](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10206)

[#10226](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10226)
- React: Fixed React 18 warnings about deprecated lifecycle methods. We removed `componentWillMount()` and `componentWillUpdate()` from Handsontable's codebase and recreated their functionality by using React's portals. [#10263](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/10263)

## [12.1.2] - 2022-07-08

### Changed

- Changed the version of the Moment.js dependency from 2.29.3 to 2.29.4, in reaction to a
  recently-found Moment.js security vulnerability. The vulnerability did not affect a correct
  configuration of Handsontable. [#9638](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9638)
- Vue: Freezed the version of the Vue framework that is used in our build chain to ~2.6. This
  shouldn't affect apps that use Vue 2.7+.

### Added

- Added smoother row and column moving when some row or columns are hidden.
  [#7613](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7613)
- Added `getNearestNotHiddenIndex()`, a new method that finds the visual index of the nearest
  not-hidden row or column and works even with large numbers of hidden rows or columns. The previous
  method, `getFirstNotHiddenIndex()`, still works, but is marked as deprecated.
  [#9064](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9064)
- Added a Czech translation. [#9343](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9343)

  warnings. [#8748](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8748)
- Angular: Moved the `@angular/core` dependency to peer dependencies.
  [#9574](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9574)

  height didn't render correctly. [#9473](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9473)
- Fixed an issue where dragging-to-scroll on mobile didn't work properly in the RTL layout
  direction. [#9475](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9475)
- Fixed an issue where hiding columns with nested headers caused incorrect column width calculation
  (for the `stretchH: 'all'` option).
  [#9496](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9496)
- Fixed an issue where `ShortcutManager` unnecessarily handled `keyup` events with no `key` defined.

- [Release notes (12.0.1)](https://handsontable.com/docs/release-notes/#_12-0-1)

## [12.0.0] - 2022-04-28

  selected range of cells with the value of the active cell.
  [#9366](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9366)

- Added support for the latest Node LTS version.
  [#9149](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9149)

### Changed

- **Breaking change**: Changed how `updateSettings()` handles data updates, to improve performance
  and the consistency of user experience. Now, when provided with a new data object,
  `updateSettings()` updates the data without resetting any states.
  [#7263](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7263)
- **Breaking change (React, Angular, Vue 2, Vue 3)**: Updating your data through a component
  property no longer resets your index mapper information and configuration options.
  [#7263](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7263)
- **Breaking change**: Changed how `updatePlugin()` reacts to `updateSettings()` calls, to improve
  performance and the consistency of user experience. Now, calls to `updateSettings()` update a
  plugin's state only when the options object contains a configuration option that's relevant to
  that particular plugin. [#9021](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9021)
- **Breaking change**: Changed the order of execution for two hooks: now, `beforeKeyDown` is
  properly fired before `afterDocumentKeyDown`.
  [#6236](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6236)
- **Breaking change**: Changed how default keyboard shortcuts are defined, to improve keyboard
  navigation consistency. Most of the shortcuts did not change and are now properly documented in
  the
  [keyboard shortcuts](https://handsontable.com/docs/keyboard-shortcuts/#default-keyboard-shortcuts)
  guide. However, some shortcuts that were not defined explicitly, and were not listed in the
  documentation, don't work anymore (e.g., <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens a cell's editor, but
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> doesn't). This change doesn't affect custom keyboard shortcuts.
  [#8942](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8942)
- **Breaking change**: Split a cross-platform modifier key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>) into two
  separate keys, to improve keyboard navigation consistency. Now, the <kbd>Cmd</kbd> key triggers
  actions on macOS where the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key triggers actions on Windows. For example, on macOS,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> doesn't work anymore: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> is used
  instead. [#9369](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9369)
- **Breaking change**: Changed the actions of the following
  [keyboard shortcuts](https://handsontable.com/docs/keyboard-shortcuts/#default-keyboard-shortcuts),
  to match the usual spreadsheet software behavior, and provide a more intuitive user experience:
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> +
  <kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
  <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd>,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
  <kbd>→</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
  <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page Up</kbd>, and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page
  Down</kbd>. [#9363](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9363)
  [#9364](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9364)
  [#9365](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9365)
- Changed two scripts of the main Handsontable workspace (`./`), to speed up the build process: now,
  the `npm run build` and `npm run test` scripts don't build or test the Handsontable examples
  (`./examples`). [#9412](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9412)
- Changed the version of the Moment.js dependency from 2.24.0 to 2.29.3, in reaction to a
  recently-found Moment.js security vulnerability that did not directly affect Handsontable.
  [#9381](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9381)
- Changed the version of the HyperFormula optional dependency from ^1.2.0 to ^2.0.0.
  [#9411](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9411)
- Changed an internal property name, from `hot.view.wt` to `hot.view._wt`, where `hot` is the name
  of your Handsontable instance. The intention of this change is to make it clear that Walkontable
  (Handsontable's rendering engine) is not a part of Handsontable's public API.
  [#8760](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8760)

### Removed

- **Breaking change**: Removed the <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> keyboard shortcut (used for cell
  merging), as it conflicted with window minimizing on macOS. The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>
  keyboard shortcut works the same as before.
  [#9368](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9368)
- **Breaking change**: Removed the <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page Up</kbd>/<kbd>Page Down</kbd>
  keyboard shortcuts from the cell editing context.
  [#9401](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9401)
- Dropped support for Internet Explorer 11 and Edge Legacy (the non-Chromium version of Edge).
  Handsontable 11.x becomes the long-term support (LTS) version for Internet Explorer 11 and Edge
  Legacy, until the end of 2023. [#7026](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7026)
- React: Removed the `enzyme` dependency from the React wrapper.
  [#9151](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9151)

  state managers. [#8372](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8372)
- Fixed an issue where using `updateSettings()` caused hidden columns to reappear.

  [#8838](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8838)
- Fixed an issue where using `updateSettings()` caused problems with column sorting.
  [#7688](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7688)
- React: Fixed an issue where using React's `setState()` within the `afterFilter` hook broke
  filtering. [#7567](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7567)
- Vue 2: Fixed an issue where repeatedly changing Handsontable's height through `updateSettings()`
  caused Handsontable to crash. [#7546](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7546)
- Vue 2: Fixed an issue where the `failed` validation status got erased when editing a new row.
  [#7541](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7541)

- Fixed an issue where the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> and
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> keyboard shortcuts didn't behave
  properly inside cell editors. [#9367](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9367)
- Fixed an issue where the dropdown menu contained unwanted rectangle elements.
  [#9240](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9240)
- React, Vue 2, Vue 3: Fixed an issue with registering modules for the React, Vue 2, and Vue 3
  wrappers, by adding an `"exports"` field to their `package.json` files.
  [#9140](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/9140)

## [8.3.0] - 2021-01-28

### Added

- Introduced a new feature that allows postponing the table render and internal data cache update.

  - plugins
  - cell types
  - editors
  - renderers
  - validators

  as separate modules, along with the Handsontable _base_. This change allows utilizing only the
  parts of Handsontable the end application is actually using, without the overhead of the full
  bundle. [#7403](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7403)

  [#7375](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7375)

### Changed

- Changed how `manualRowMove` and `manualColumnMove` plugins work
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Click on a row header will select all cells (also hidden).
  [#2391](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/2391)
- Extracted Cell-Meta logic from Core to separate module.
  [#6254](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6254)
- The `CellMeta` manager was refactored for future features and improvements.
  [#6233](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6233)
- Rows can be resized to less than `rowHeights`.
  [#6149](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6149)
- Left mouse button (LMB) click on the corner will now select all cells.
  [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The right mouse button (`RMB`) click on the corner, column and row headers will show just some
  options, defined by newly created specification
  [#7082](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/7082)
- Hidden indexes will no longer be rendered, as a consequence `afterRenderer`, `modifyColWidth`,
  `beforeStretchingColumnWidth` will be executable only on visible (meaning, rendered) rows and
  columns. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The `getColWidth` for hidden index will return 0 - it used to return 0.1
  [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The `modifyColWidth` hook isn't called internally. However, it will be executed when the user will
  call the `getColWidth`. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- Hidden rows/columns won't rendered anymore. As a consequence hooks `beforeValueRender`,
  `beforeRenderer`, `afterRenderer`, `modifyColWidth`, `beforeStretchingColumnWidth` etc. will be
  executed just for some of the columns (just the renderable ones).
  [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- Selection behavior changed when hiding cells from the `ContextMenu`, now it is selecting a column
  on the right when there is space on right to the last selected column, selecting a column on the
  left otherwise. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable#6547)
- Developed a unified way to identify HOT "input" elements. All input elements owned by HOT got an
  attribute "data-hot-input" which are identified by that key.
  [#6383](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6383)
- `NestedHeaders` plugin was rewritten, from now on, only a tree-like structure will be allowed,
  meaning, there will be no possibility to place nested headers in-between layers.
  [#6716](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6716)
- `CustomBorders` plugin was adapted to work with `HiddenColumns` properly, from now on hiding cells
  at the start or at the end of a range will also hide their borders. Also, hiding a single cell
  with borders will hide all of its borders.
  [#7083](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/7083)
- `CollapsibleColumns` will no longer use `HiddenColumns` plugin to work.
  [#6204](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issue/6204)
- Modifying the table's data by reference and calling `render()` will not work properly anymore.
  From this point onward, all the data-related operations need to be performed using the API
  methods, such as `populateFromArray` or `setDataAtCell`.
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Removed dependencies between plugins: the `manualColumnFreeze` plugin doesn't use the
  `manualColumnMove`, the `collapsibleColumns` plugin doesn't use the `hiddenColumns` plugin,
  `nestedRows` plugin doesn't use the `trimRows` plugin, `filters` plugin doesn't use the `trimRows`
  plugin anymore. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945) along with other
  adjustments [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547):
- The `minSpareRows` and `minRows` options will ensure that the number of visible rows corresponds
  to the value provided to them (for example, the `trimRows` plugin won't have an impact on the
  number of displayed rows). [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- `toPhysicalRow` and `toVisualColumn` now return `null` for non-existant rows/columns.
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `afterLoadData` hook receives a different set of arguments. It used to be just the initialLoad
  flag, now the first argument is `sourceData`, followed by `initialLoad`.
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `manualColumnFreeze` plugin unfreezes the column just after the "line of freeze".
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `RecordTranslator` object and the `t` property available in the plugins were removed.
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- After-prefixed hooks (`afterLoadData`, `afterFilter`, etc.) are now called just before the
  `render` call. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Newly created rows and columns are now placed in the source data in the place calculated from its
  position in the visual context (they "stick" to their adjacent rows/columns). It also applies to
  moved rows and columns. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- When the `nestedRows` plugin is `enabled`, moving rows will be possible only using the UI or by
  calling the `dragRows` method of the `manualRowMove` plugin.
  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `beforeRowResize`, `afterRowResize`, `beforeColumnResize`, `afterColumnResize` hooks have the
  order of their arguments rearranged for the sake of consistency with other hooks.
  [#3328](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3328)
- Changed the argument structure in `collapsibleColumns`' `toggleCollapsibleSection` method.
  [#6193](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6193)
- Updated the `moment`, `numbro` and `pikaday` dependencies to their latest versions.
  [#6610](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6610)
- Standardize the `z-index` properties between the overlays.
  [#6269](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6269)

  [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- `HeaderTooltips` plugin becomes deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.
