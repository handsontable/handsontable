# AGENTS.md — Playwright functional E2E tier (`tests/`)

Functional, real-browser E2E for the whole monorepo lives here (`e2e/*.spec.ts`).
Visual regression is a separate package (`visual-tests/`). Task workflow: the
`handsontable-playwright-e2e` skill. Setup and commands: [`README.md`](./README.md).

## The matrix — six projects, two axes

- `theme` (main / horizon / classic) × `bundle` (`umd` = `dist/handsontable.js`,
  `full-min` = `dist/handsontable.full.min.js`) → projects `e2e-<theme>` and
  `e2e-<theme>-min`, 1:1 with the Puppeteer legs (`test:e2e` / `test:production`).
- Every spec runs on all six legs automatically. Author against
  `fixtures/test.ts` (`import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/test'`),
  destructure `{ page, theme, bundle }`, and pass both to the page object.
- **Local gates run `e2e-main` (plain UMD) only** — pre-push, the Claude Stop
  hook, and `npm run test:e2e` are pinned there; the `-min` legs are CI-only.
  (`e2e-main` used to load `full.min` — never assume the hooks cover min.)
- `handsontable.full.js` and `handsontable.min.js` are deliberately untested
  here — they belong to the nightly on develop (DEV-2058).

## Fixture contract (never get these wrong)

- Fixtures are standalone HTML under `fixtures/demo/`, served statically. Every
  fixture MUST copy the fail-loud param block from `demo/grid.html`:
  `?theme=`/`?bundle=` map through fixed allowlists to LITERALS (no XSS); an
  absent param keeps the default (main / plain UMD), an unknown value THROWS —
  a config typo must be one red leg, never a silently mislabeled green one.
  Never hardcode a bundle `<script src=…>`.
- Thread `bundle` end-to-end: fixture allowlist → page-object constructor
  (`(page, theme = 'main', bundle = 'umd')`) → `goto()` query params → spec
  destructure. Miss one link and a leg silently tests the wrong build.
- The `umd` legs run the BASE bundle: **no HyperFormula** (a formulas fixture
  loads HF as an external script beside the bundle, or the plugin logs a
  warning and silently stays off) and **no languages pack** (an i18n fixture
  loads `dist/languages/all.js` explicitly — the Puppeteer harness does that
  for you, this tier does not).
- **On `autocomplete` / `dropdown`, a centred `cell.click()` can land on the
  dropdown arrow and open the editor by itself.** `autocompleteRenderer`
  registers a `mousedown` listener that opens the list whenever the press lands
  on `.htAutocompleteArrow`, so the editor is already open before your
  `keyboard.press('Enter')` — and that Enter then correctly commits and closes
  it. The spec fails at "the editor never opened" with nothing in the log to
  point at the cause. Whether the click lands on the arrow is pure geometry: the
  arrow is 16 px wide and right-floated, so in a cell at the 50 px default column
  width it spans x=24–40 while the centre is x=25. An EMPTY cell is the common
  way to end up at that default width, which is why empty fixtures trip it and
  seeded ones usually do not — but a long header or narrow content puts the arrow
  back under the centre, so cell content is not a guarantee. Click off-centre, or
  select with `hot.selectCell()`, when the spec means to open the editor with
  Enter. Root-caused in DEV-2677; the arrow's own coverage is
  `e2e/autocomplete-arrow-button.spec.ts`.
- **Seed an `autocomplete` / `dropdown` fixture with a prefix the whole column's
  choice set shares** (`'Al'` for `Alpha/Alfa/Alto`), so `autocomplete`, which
  filters by the typed value, renders the same list as `dropdown`, which forces
  `filter: false`, and one assertion covers both. Reference:
  `fixtures/demo/autocomplete-async-source.html`.
- A fixture-served library MUST be a dependency of THIS package, loaded from
  `/tests/node_modules/…` — CI installs only the filtered `handsontable-tests`
  workspace, so a path into any other package's `node_modules` does not exist
  there (and the static server refuses it locally too, for CI parity). **Pin
  the exact version the owning package's lockfile carries** — an identical
  RANGE is not enough (both packages declared `^3.0.0` and still locked 3.3.0
  vs 3.4.0, because pnpm resolves each importer at its own time). One
  `hyperformula` entry in `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the invariant; two entries mean
  the `umd` legs test a different engine than the one baked into `full.min`.
  Moving the version into the pnpm catalog is the durable upgrade when the
  core package can take that change.
- The green-run cache (`scripts/e2e-run-cache.mjs`) hashes BOTH bundles, the
  fixture-served HyperFormula artifact + `tests/package.json`, and every file
  under `fixtures/`; rebuilding a bundle or reinstalling the engine re-runs
  affected specs. Do not narrow that hash.

## Touch and mobile specs

- Page objects for mobile specs live in `fixtures/pages/mobile/` (as walkontable's do in
  `fixtures/pages/walkontable/`). A mobile spec must declare
  `test.use({ ...devices['iPhone 13'], browserName: 'chromium' })`: Handsontable decides
  whether to create the mobile selection handles from the **user agent, at grid construction
  time**, so without the emulation the handles never exist and the spec fails for the wrong
  reason. Assert the handle is visible before touching it.
- `page.touchscreen` only **taps** — it has no drag. A touch drag needs CDP
  (`page.context().newCDPSession(page)` → `Input.dispatchTouchEvent`), which is also why those
  specs pin `browserName: 'chromium'`. Nothing else here emits trusted `touchmove`.
- Auto-scroll assertions must check **progress while the pointer rests**, never that one offset
  is non-zero: extending a selection onto a partially visible row or column scrolls it into view
  on its own, so `scrollTop > 0` passes with the auto-scroller dead. The scroll timer
  reschedules itself, so one `touchmove` past the edge starts it — poll for a further increase
  instead of holding for a fixed time (`waitForTimeout` is banned, see below).

## Rendering below 100% (zoom / display scaling)

Reach for **CSS `zoom` on the root element**, applied by the fixture before the grid is
constructed (`fixtures/demo/row-height-device-scale.html`). Chrome routes it through the same
effective-zoom machinery as browser page zoom, so a cell's 1px border is inflated exactly as it
is under Ctrl+minus or Windows display scaling — `getComputedStyle` reads `1.111px` at 0.9
either way. Assert that inflation as the test's own precondition; without it every geometry
assertion passes on unfixed code.

The two things that do **not** work: Playwright's context-level `deviceScaleFactor` reports the
ratio faithfully but never inflates the border, so a test built on it is vacuous; and
`--force-device-scale-factor` needs `viewport: null`, which every project's
`devices['Desktop Chrome']` forbids by pinning `deviceScaleFactor` (`deviceScaleFactor:
undefined` in `test.use` does not clear it, and `launchOptions` is rejected inside a
`describe` — it forces its own worker).

## The server port

The webServer binds `8123` and has `reuseExistingServer` on outside CI, so a second
checkout — a worktree beside the main clone — silently attaches to the **first
one's server and build** and reports results describing the wrong code. Set
`HOT_TEST_PORT` to a free port to run two at once; the config passes it to
`support/static-server.mjs`, so the two never disagree. Before believing a strange
result, check who owns the port with `lsof -i :8123`. Background in
`.ai/WORKTREES.md`.

## Determinism

Ships at `error` in `.eslintrc.cjs`: no `waitForTimeout`, `sleep`,
`networkidle`, `.only`, `.skip`, or bare `test.fixme` in specs. Wait on
web-first assertions; `expect.poll` for data probes. `test.fixme` is the
tracked exception for a real product bug: it requires an eslint-disable line
naming the task (`// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax --
DEV-1234: <why>`), which keeps every parked test counted and attributable.
Full rules: the `handsontable-playwright-e2e` skill and its
